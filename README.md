# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a tour guide, <br> 
> I want to know what cancellation rates and delay times I can expect, <br> 
> so that I can plan my tours around any potential delays. 

## Dataset 

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umeradnaan/flight-delays-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umeradnaan/flight-delays-dataset)
- **DelayMinutes** (double) - describing the minutes each flight was delayed
- **Cancelled** (boolean but we changed this to a String) - providing a true or false for whether a flight was delayed

## Description 

Our project provided helpful data for a tour guide who needed to know what to expect in terms of flight cancellations and delays. We created methods that found how many flights out of the total in the dataset were cancelled and that found the average flight delay time in minutes.
